Step-by-Step Plan for Integrating Supabase Authentication and Database
Overview
The plan involves replacing the existing dummy authentication system (lib/auth.ts) with Supabase Authentication and integrating Supabase Database to store user data and credits. The integration will maintain the current functionality, including user authentication, profile management, and credit tracking, while leveraging Supabase for secure and scalable backend services.
Step 1: Set Up Supabase Project

Create a new Supabase project via the Supabase Dashboard.
Obtain the Supabase URL and Anon Key from the project settings.
Store these credentials securely in .env.local (already ignored by .gitignore).

Impacted Files:

.env.local (create or update to include Supabase credentials)

Step 2: Configure Supabase Client

Initialize the Supabase client in a dedicated utility file to handle authentication and database interactions.
Ensure the client is accessible across the application, particularly for authentication and user data management.

Impacted Files:

lib/supabase.ts (new file to initialize and export Supabase client)
package.json (verify Supabase dependencies are included; already present)

Step 3: Update Authentication Provider

Modify the AuthProvider to use Supabase Authentication instead of the dummy auth system.
Update context to handle Supabase user sessions, including login, signup, logout, and profile updates.
Replace dummy user checks with Supabase session management.

Impacted Files:

components/auth-provider.tsx (update to use Supabase auth)

Step 4: Replace Dummy Auth Logic

Remove the dummy authentication logic and replace it with Supabase Authentication methods (e.g., signInWithPassword, signUp, signOut).
Update user creation and authentication functions to interact with Supabase Auth.

Impacted Files:

lib/auth.ts (replace dummy auth with Supabase Auth functions)

Step 5: Set Up Supabase Database

Create a users table in Supabase to store user data (e.g., id, email, display_name, credits).
Define table schema and Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data.
Update database interactions to use Supabase Database instead of dummy user array.

Impacted Files:

None directly (database schema managed in Supabase Dashboard)

Step 6: Update User Data Management

Modify functions for retrieving and updating user data (e.g., getUserByEmail, updateUserCredits) to query the Supabase users table.
Ensure credit updates are performed securely with proper validation.

Impacted Files:

lib/auth.ts (update data access functions to use Supabase Database)
actions/summarize-video.ts (update user credit checks and updates to use Supabase)

Step 7: Update Authentication Pages

Update the signup page to use Supabase for user registration, including storing display_name and initializing credits.
Update the login page to authenticate users via Supabase.
Update the profile page to fetch and update user data from Supabase.

Impacted Files:

app/signup/page.tsx (update signup form to use Supabase Auth)
app/login/page.tsx (update login form to use Supabase Auth)
app/profile/page.tsx (update profile data fetching and updates to use Supabase)

Step 8: Update Dashboard

Ensure the dashboard fetches user data and credits from Supabase.
Update any user-related displays (e.g., welcome message, credits) to reflect Supabase data.

Impacted Files:

app/dashboard/page.tsx (update user data and credits display)

Step 9: Secure Server-Side Actions

Update server-side actions (e.g., video summarization) to use Supabase client for user authentication and data access.
Ensure proper session management for server-side operations.

Impacted Files:

actions/summarize-video.ts (update to use Supabase for user validation and credit updates)

Step 10: Test and Validate

Test signup, login, logout, profile updates, and video summarization flows.
Verify that credits are correctly managed in the Supabase Database.
Ensure RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access.
Validate error handling for authentication and database operations.

Impacted Files:

None directly (testing involves all modified files)

Step 11: Update Environment Variables

Ensure all environment variables (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) are correctly set in .env.local and documented for deployment.

Impacted Files:

.env.local (update with Supabase credentials)
next.config.mjs (ensure environment variables are accessible)

Summary of Impacted Files

.env.local (add Supabase credentials)
lib/supabase.ts (new file for Supabase client)
lib/auth.ts (replace dummy auth with Supabase Auth and Database)
components/auth-provider.tsx (update to use Supabase Auth)
app/signup/page.tsx (update signup to use Supabase)
app/login/page.tsx (update login to use Supabase)
app/profile/page.tsx (update profile to use Supabase)
app/dashboard/page.tsx (update user data and credits display)
actions/summarize-video.ts (update user validation and credit updates)
next.config.mjs (ensure environment variable access)
package.json (verify Supabase dependencies)

Notes

Ensure Supabase dependencies (@supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs, etc.) are correctly installed (already present in package.json).
Use Supabase's Row-Level Security to secure user data access.
Test thoroughly to ensure session management works across client and server contexts.
Document any new environment variables for team members or deployment.

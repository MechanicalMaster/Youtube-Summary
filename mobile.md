#### Implementation Plan

1. **Add a Hamburger Menu Toggle for Mobile Screens**
   - Introduce a state to manage the visibility of the menu on mobile screens (e.g., `isMenuOpen`).
   - Add a hamburger icon (using an icon from `lucide-react`, which is already a dependency) that appears only on mobile screens (`<sm` breakpoint in Tailwind).
   - When the hamburger icon is clicked, toggle the visibility of the menu.
   - **Files Impacted**:
     - `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`: Modify the component to include the state and hamburger toggle logic.
     - Use `lucide-react` for the hamburger icon (e.g., `Menu` icon).

2. **Modify the Menu Layout for Mobile**
   - Update the menu (`<nav>` and user info section) to collapse into a vertical dropdown when the hamburger menu is toggled.
   - Use Tailwind’s responsive classes (e.g., `sm:flex hidden` for desktop, `block` for mobile when open) to control visibility and layout.
   - Ensure the menu takes up the full width of the screen on mobile and is positioned below the header bar (e.g., as a full-screen overlay or a dropdown).
   - **Files Impacted**:
     - `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`: Update the JSX structure and Tailwind classes for the `<nav>` and user info section.

3. **Style the Mobile Menu**
   - Style the mobile menu to align with the existing design (e.g., use `bg-white`, `shadow-sm`, and existing color variables from `app/globals.css` like `--primary`).
   - Ensure the menu is accessible (e.g., add proper ARIA attributes to the hamburger button).
   - Add a close button or allow clicking the hamburger icon again to close the menu.
   - **Files Impacted**:
     - `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`: Add Tailwind classes for styling the mobile menu.
     - Optionally, `app/globals.css`: Add custom styles if needed (though Tailwind should suffice).

4. **Adjust the Header Layout for Mobile**
   - Ensure the header bar (containing the app title and hamburger icon) remains fixed at the top and fits within the mobile viewport.
   - Use Tailwind’s `flex` and `justify-between` to align the title and hamburger icon properly.
   - **Files Impacted**:
     - `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`: Update the `<header>` section to handle mobile layout.

5. **Test Responsiveness**
   - Ensure the menu transitions smoothly between mobile and desktop layouts at the `sm` breakpoint (640px).
   - Verify that the menu doesn’t overflow on smaller screens and that all elements (links, user info, buttons) are accessible without zooming.
   - No file changes required for this step, but it’s a critical validation step.

#### Configuration or Database Migrations
- **No configuration or database migrations** are required for this change, as it’s purely a front-end UI adjustment.
- The app already uses Tailwind CSS and `lucide-react`, so no new dependencies are needed.

#### Notes on Existing Architecture
- The codebase uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design (e.g., `sm:`, `md:` prefixes), as seen in `app/globals.css` and various components. The proposed changes align with this pattern.
- The `DashboardLayout` component already handles user authentication and navigation, so adding a mobile menu fits within its responsibilities.
- The app uses `lucide-react` for icons (e.g., `Home`, `History`, `LogOut`), so using the `Menu` icon for the hamburger toggle is consistent.

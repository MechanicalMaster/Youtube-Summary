### Planning Phase

Based on the assumptions, here is a step-by-step implementation plan to add the "Contact Us", "Terms and Conditions", and "Refund and Cancellation" pages to the landing page with distinct URLs.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Create New Page Components**:
   - Create three new page components for "Contact Us", "Terms and Conditions", and "Refund and Cancellation".
   - Each page will be a static React component using Tailwind CSS for styling and the `Card` component from `components/ui/card.tsx` for consistent design.
   - Add placeholder content (e.g., headings and sample text) that can be replaced with actual content later.
   - Define metadata for each page to support SEO.

   **Impacted Files**:
   - `app/contact-us/page.tsx` (new file)
   - `app/terms-and-conditions/page.tsx` (new file)
   - `app/refund-and-cancellation/page.tsx` (new file)

2. **Update the Landing Page to Include Links**:
   - Modify the landing page (`app/page.tsx`) to add a footer section.
   - Add links to the new pages using the `Link` component from `next/link` and style them with Tailwind CSS.
   - Use a `nav` element with `Button` or `Link` components for consistency with the existing navigation style (e.g., `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`).

   **Impacted Files**:
   - `app/page.tsx`

3. **Ensure Pages Use the Root Layout**:
   - Verify that the new pages inherit the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`), which includes the `ThemeProvider` and `AuthProvider`.
   - No changes are needed unless a specific layout is required for these pages.

   **Impacted Files**:
   - None (uses existing `app/layout.tsx`)

4. **Add Routing Configuration**:
   - Next.js automatically handles routing based on the file structure (e.g., `app/contact-us/page.tsx` maps to `/contact-us`).
   - No additional configuration is needed in `next.config.mjs` unless custom rewrites or redirects are required.

   **Impacted Files**:
   - None

5. **Update Global Styles (Optional)**:
   - If specific styling is needed for the footer or page content (e.g., custom footer classes), add them to the global CSS file.
   - Ensure consistency with existing Tailwind CSS conventions (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`).

   **Impacted Files**:
   - `app/globals.css` (if custom styles are needed)

6. **Test Accessibility and Responsiveness**:
   - Ensure the new footer links and pages are accessible (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
   - Verify responsiveness using Tailwindâ€™s responsive classes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`).
   - Test that the pages are publicly accessible without requiring authentication.

   **Impacted Files**:
   - None (testing phase, but may require minor tweaks to `app/page.tsx` or new page files)

#### Configuration or Database Migrations Required
- **Configuration**: No changes are needed in `next.config.mjs` or environment variables, as the feature uses existing Next.js routing and Tailwind CSS.
- **Database Migrations**: None required, as the pages are static and do not interact with Supabase or any backend services (based on assumptions). If "Contact Us" requires a form with backend submission, a new table or API endpoint may be needed, which would require further clarification.

#### Notes on Existing Architecture
- The codebase uses Next.js 15 with the App Router, Tailwind CSS, and a component library (`components/ui/`) based on Radix UI.
- The root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) applies global styles and providers, ensuring consistency across pages.
- The authentication system (`components/auth-provider.tsx`) protects dashboard routes but not the root route, making it suitable for public pages.
- The plan follows the existing convention of kebab-case routes (e.g., `/sign-up`, `/log-in`) and Tailwind CSS styling.

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Add a Delete Button to the SummaryTile Component**
   - Modify the `SummaryTile` component to include a "Delete" button on each tile. The button should be styled to match the existing UI (e.g., using the `Button` component with a subtle variant like `ghost` or `outline`).
   - Ensure the button is visually integrated with the tile's design, possibly positioned in the top-right corner for consistency with modern UI patterns.
   - **Files Impacted**:
     - `components/ui/summary-tile.tsx`: Add the "Delete" button to the JSX structure of the `SummaryTile` component.

2. **Integrate the AlertDialog Component for Confirmation**
   - Use the existing `AlertDialog` component to create a confirmation pop-up when the "Delete" button is clicked.
   - The pop-up should display the message: "Are you sure you want to delete the summary for '{videoTitle}'?" with "Cancel" and "Delete" buttons.
   - Add state management in the `SummaryTile` component to control the visibility of the pop-up (e.g., using a `useState` hook to track whether the dialog is open).
   - **Files Impacted**:
     - `components/ui/summary-tile.tsx`: Import the `AlertDialog` components and add the confirmation dialog logic.

3. **Create a Server Action to Handle Deletion**
   - Create a new server action (e.g., `deleteSummary`) to handle the deletion of a summary from the Supabase database.
   - The action should:
     - Verify that the summary belongs to the current user by comparing `user_id` with the authenticated user's ID.
     - Delete the summary from the `summaries` table using `supabaseAdmin` (to bypass RLS, as done in `actions/summarize-video.ts`).
     - Include logging for the deletion event (similar to the logging in `actions/summarize-video.ts`).
   - Return a success or error response to the client.
   - **Files Impacted**:
     - Create a new file `actions/delete-summary.ts`: Define the `deleteSummary` server action.

4. **Update the HistoryPage to Handle Deletion and Refresh**
   - In the `HistoryPage` component, add a function to handle the deletion of a summary by calling the `deleteSummary` server action.
   - After a successful deletion, update the `summaries` state to remove the deleted summary, which will automatically refresh the UI (since the UI is driven by the `summaries` state).
   - If the deletion fails, display an error message using the existing `Alert` component (similar to how errors are handled in `HistoryPage`).
   - **Files Impacted**:
     - `app/(dashboard)/history/page.tsx`: Add the deletion handler and update the state after deletion.

5. **Add Permission Check in the Server Action**
   - In the `deleteSummary` server action, enforce that only the user who created the summary can delete it by comparing the `user_id` of the summary with the authenticated user's ID (similar to the check in `app/(dashboard)/summary/[id]/page.tsx`).
   - Log the permission check result for debugging purposes.
   - **Files Impacted**:
     - `actions/delete-summary.ts`: Add the permission check logic.

6. **Add Logging for Deletion Events**
   - Add detailed logging in the `deleteSummary` server action to track the deletion request, permission check, and outcome (success or failure).
   - Follow the logging pattern used in `actions/summarize-video.ts` (e.g., logging timestamps, user details, and operation details).
   - **Files Impacted**:
     - `actions/delete-summary.ts`: Add logging statements.

#### Configuration or Database Migrations
- **No Database Migrations Required**: The deletion operation will simply remove a record from the `summaries` table, and there are no cascading effects to consider (as confirmed).
- **No Configuration Changes Required**: The existing Supabase setup (`supabaseAdmin`) already supports the necessary permissions to delete records while bypassing RLS.

#### Additional Notes
- The implementation will reuse existing UI components (`Button`, `AlertDialog`, `Alert`) to maintain consistency with the current UX/UI.
- The automatic UI refresh will be handled by updating the `summaries` state in `HistoryPage`, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- The permission check ensures security by restricting deletion to the summary owner, aligning with the existing pattern in the codebase.

This plan provides a clear path for a developer to implement the feature while adhering to the current architecture and conventions in the codebase. Let me know if you'd like to adjust any part of the plan!
